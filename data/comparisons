      "whenToCompare": "High Fc Myotis with inflection (Step 30 or 60)",
      "diagnosticNotes": [
        "Strong inflection around 45–50 kHz with pronounced knee, heel, and toe",
        "Often exhibits terminal hook at end of pulse",
        "May resemble PESU in steep broadband examples",
        "Slope alone should not override inflection pattern"

        "Minimum slope greater than 200 per USFWS 2024 guidance",
        "Typically steeper and cleaner than MYSO",
